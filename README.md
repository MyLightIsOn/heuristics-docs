# A11yBase Heuristic Learning System 

Welcome to the **A11yBase **—a user-centered accessibility learning tool designed to help teams build more inclusive digital experiences from the start.

## What is the ABD System?

The ABD System is a **heuristic-based learning guide** that introduces accessibility through the lens of **user experience**, not just technical compliance.

It’s built to be:

- Beginner-friendly
- UX-focused
- Practical and approachable
- A bridge between design, development, and accessibility

Instead of starting with complex specifications like WCAG, the ABD System helps you ask simple questions like:
> “Can this be used without a mouse?”  
> “Does this make sense if you can’t see it?”

These heuristics are designed to spark **curiosity, conversations, and better habits**—so accessibility becomes part of your team’s everyday thinking.

## What’s in the repo?

- A full set of accessibility heuristics, organized by user experience categories
- A learning guide for each heuristic, including what to check, why it matters, and tips for designers and developers
- Example code and interactive pages to experiment with accessible (and inaccessible) patterns
- Supporting documentation to help teams learn together

## 🧠 Who is this for?

This project is built for:

- Designers who want to build more inclusive interfaces
- Developers who want practical accessibility tips
- Product teams that are just starting their accessibility journey
- Anyone who wants to understand accessibility in a human-centered way

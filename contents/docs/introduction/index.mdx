## Documents

**A11yBase** is a practical guide to understanding digital accessibility from a human-centered perspective. It’s designed for designers, developers, writers, QA testers, or anyone who contributes to building digital experiences. Rather than focusing solely on compliance checklists or WCAG legalese, A11yBase grounds accessibility in real-world interactions and usability.

It introduces a set of core heuristics patterns of accessible design that help teams think about how people actually navigate and experience software. The goal is to build empathy, sharpen design instincts, and make accessibility a shared, intuitive part of everyday product work.

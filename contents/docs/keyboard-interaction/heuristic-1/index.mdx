title: Are buttons, links, and other CTAs designed to consider both hover and focus states?
description: Keyboard Interaction - Heuristic 1
---

### What this means
This one’s about making sure that when someone interacts with a button or link, whether using a mouse or a keyboard, they actually get some visual feedback.

With a mouse, it’s easy. You hover over something, and it changes color, underlines, glows, or something similar. But people who use a keyboard don’t hover, they tab through the page. So instead of hover styles, they rely on focus styles to know where they are.

This heuristic is basically asking:
**“Are we styling for both types of users, mouse and keyboard?”**

### Why this matters
A lot of sites look fine when you use a mouse, but if you tab through them, it’s like nothing’s happening. There’s no visual sign that you’re on a button or link, even though you technically are. That makes things confusing or totally unusable for keyboard users.

It’s not enough to just design for hover, we have to think about focus too. Both matter.
If someone can't see which element is currently focused, they might accidentally activate the wrong thing, like submitting a form too early, clicking the wrong link, or skipping something important altogether.

### What to check for
- Are there visible changes when hovering and focusing on buttons or links?
- Does the focus style stand out enough to be noticed?
- Do custom UI components (like dropdowns or sliders) also respond to focus?
- Has the `:focus` style been forgotten or removed completely?

title: Is tabbing order predictable, logical, and intuitive?
---

### What this means
When someone uses the keyboard to move through a page, typically by pressing the `Tab` key, the order in which elements receive focus should make sense. Focus should follow the visual reading flow of the page. That usually means top to bottom and left to right.

If the tabbing order jumps around unexpectedly or skips important elements, it makes the interface harder to use and understand.

### Why this matters
Keyboard users do not experience the whole interface at once. They move through it one element at a time. If the tab order is unpredictable, people can get lost, miss key actions, or become confused about where they are. That can result in missed content, broken tasks, and a frustrating experience.

For users of screen readers, the tabbing order is also how content is announced. A logical, intuitive flow improves usability for everyone.

### What to check for
- Does focus move from top to bottom and left to right in a way that matches the visual layout?
- Are key elements, like buttons and form fields, included in the tab order?
- Do modals and overlays move focus into the new content when opened?
- When those elements close, does focus return to where it started?
- Are there any elements that unexpectedly receive focus, such as hidden or offscreen items?

### What this feels like
- **[Example 1](/examples/keyboard-interaction/heuristic-1/1)** - Predictable, logical tab order
- **[Example 2](/examples/keyboard-interaction/heuristic-1/2)** - Bad tab order
- **[Example 3](/examples/keyboard-interaction/heuristic-1/3)** - Modal tab order
- **[Example 4](/examples/keyboard-interaction/heuristic-1/4)** - Confusing modals

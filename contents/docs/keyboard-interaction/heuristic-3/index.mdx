title: Are buttons, links, and other CTAs designed and implemented to consider both hover and focus states?
---

### What this means
Interactive elements like buttons, links, and calls-to-action (CTAs) should provide clear visual feedback. Not only on hover (for mouse users), but also on focus (for keyboard users). Both states need to be obvious and distinct so that all users know when an element is interactive and ready to be activated.

Remember, hover styles alone aren’t enough because keyboard users don’t “hover” with a cursor.

### Why this matters
Without visual feedback, users can lose track of where they are in the interface or not realize that an element is interactive. This can happen with both mouse and keyboard users.

Clear and intentional hover and focus styles create consistency across interaction types. They reassure users that the element is interactive, improve usability, and prevent confusion, frustration, or errors when navigating through an interface.

A hover-only style assumes that everyone uses a mouse, which leaves out people who rely on the keyboard. Without a visible focus state, it can feel like the interface is unresponsive or broken.

### What to check for
- Do all buttons, links, and CTAs have a clear hover style for mouse users?
- Do those same elements also have a clear and distinct focus style for keyboard users?
- Is the focus indicator easy to see and not removed by custom styling?
- Do custom components (like menus or accordions) provide visual feedback for both hover and focus?

title: Are adjacent links pointing to unique locations combined into a single call-to-action?
---

### What this means
Sometimes components place two separate links next to each other, such as one link on an image and another on a headline, even though both go to the same page.

For mouse users, this might seem trival. But for keyboard and screen reader users, it adds unnecessary friction. They must tab through or listen to duplicate links that serve the same purpose.

Instead of creating multiple touchpoints for the same action, it is often better to combine them into one clear, accessible call-to-action.

### Why this matters
Redundant links may not break functionality, but they create clutter and confusion for non-mouse users. A screen reader might announce “View Details” twice in a row, leading a user to wonder: “Are these different links? Should I check both?”

This kind of repetition slows down navigation and increases [cognitive load](https://lawsofux.com/cognitive-load/), especially on pages with repeated elements like product listings or blog grids. Two links per card can double the work with no added value.

### What to check for
- Are there multiple adjacent links that point to the same destination?
- Could those links be combined into a single, larger, more obvious clickable area?
- Does the repetition make the page visually or cognitively harder to navigate?

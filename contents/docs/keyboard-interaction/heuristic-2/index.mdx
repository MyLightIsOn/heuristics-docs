title: Is the focus indicator clearly visible when active elements receive focus?
---

### What this means
When someone uses the keyboard to move around a page, typically by pressing the `Tab` key, there should be a clear visual indicator that shows where the current focus is. Focus is where the user is "located" in the interface. This could be a border, outline, glow, or any other style that stands out from the rest of the interface.

If there is no visual cue, or if it is too subtle, keyboard users may have no idea where they are on the page. Navigating like this is confusing and frustrating. It can feel like trying to use a website with your eyes closed.

Focus should **ONLY** be on interactive elements, like buttons and form fields. Regular text should be skipped as it is not interactive.

### Why this matters
Not everyone uses a mouse. Some users rely entirely on the keyboard to interact with websites and applications. If they cannot see where the focus is, they may skip important elements, activate the wrong control, or get lost entirely.

This is a small detail that makes a big difference in usability. When the focus indicator is visible and consistent, users feel confident and in control of the interface.

### What to check for
- Is there a clear visual change when tabbing to an interactive element such as a button, link, or form field?
- Does the focus style stand out against all types of backgrounds?
- Do custom UI components, like modals or sliders, include visible focus styles?
- Has the browser’s default `outline` style been removed without providing a replacement? (That's bad!)

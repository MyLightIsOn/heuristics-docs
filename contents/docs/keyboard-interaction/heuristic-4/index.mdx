title: Are we avoiding keyboard traps?
---

### What this means
A keyboard trap happens when someone using the keyboard gets stuck on a part of the page and cannot move forward or backward using the `Tab` or `Shift + Tab` keys. It is like falling into a hole with no way out. You are stuck on a form field, modal, iframe, or custom widget, and there is no way to continue navigating without a mouse.

Keyboard users need to be able to move freely through a page. If any part of the interface traps focus without an escape method, the user experience breaks down.

### Why this matters
Not everyone uses a mouse. For many users, the keyboard is their only way to navigate. If they get stuck in a modal, menu, or embedded widget, they may have to reload the page or abandon their task entirely.

Keyboard traps are more than just frustrating. They can block access to important information or functionality, making parts of a site completely unusable for some users.

### What to check for
- Can you tab into and out of every section of the page?
- When a modal or pop-up opens, does it trap focus in a way that is intentional and controlled?
- Can you exit modals or pop-ups using the `Escape` key or a visible close button?
- Are iframes or embedded widgets keyboard-accessible and not causing tabbing issues?

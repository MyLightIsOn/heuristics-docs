title: Is there a skip-to-main-content link provided?
---

### What this means
A skip-to-main-content link (or "skip link") is a navigation shortcut that appears at the very beginning of a page. It allows keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation menus and jump directly to the main content area with a single action.

These links are typically hidden visually until they receive keyboard focus, at which point they become visible. When activated, they move the user's focus directly to the main content section of the page.

### Why this matters
Keyboard users and screen reader users often have to tab through every single navigation item before reaching the main content. On pages with extensive menus, this can mean dozens of tab presses just to start reading the actual content.

Skip links dramatically improve this experience by providing a shortcut past these obstacles. They're especially important for people with motor disabilities who find repeated keyboard actions difficult or tiring, and for screen reader users who otherwise must listen to the same navigation options on every page.

### What to check for
- Is a skip link the very first focusable element on the page?
- Does the skip link become visible when it receives keyboard focus?
- When activated, does it actually move focus to the main content area?
- Is the link text clear and descriptive (e.g., "Skip to main content" rather than just "Skip")?

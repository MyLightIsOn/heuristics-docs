title: Are errors described in text?
---

### What this means
When a user encounters an error in a form or process, the system must describe the issue using clear and specific text. Error indicators such as color, icons, or highlights should be accompanied by textual descriptions that explain the problem and how to resolve it.

### Why this matters
Users who are blind, color-blind, or have cognitive disabilities may not perceive visual error cues. Textual descriptions ensure that all users can understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Ambiguous or missing error messages increase frustration and prevent task completion.

### What to check
- Verify that error messages appear in text near the related input field or in a clearly identified alert region.
- Confirm that error descriptions clearly explain what the issue is (e.g., “Email address is required” or “Password must be at least 8 characters”).
- Ensure that errors are not communicated using color alone.
- Check that suggestions for resolving the issue are provided when applicable.

title: Are recurring navigation patterns and functionalities presented and labeled consistently throughout the system?
---

### What this means
Recurring navigation patterns, components, and functionalities should appear and behave consistently throughout a digital product. Labels, positioning, and structure must remain uniform to support user orientation and predictability.

### Why this matters
Consistency in navigation and interface behavior reduces cognitive load and supports users who rely on familiarity to interact efficiently. For users with cognitive or visual impairments, inconsistent navigation can cause disorientation, increase error rates, and hinder task completion.

### What to check
- Confirm that navigation menus, header/footer elements, and repeated interface components maintain the same order and structure across pages.
- Verify that buttons or links serving the same function are labeled identically throughout the system.
- Ensure that repeated actions (e.g., “Submit,” “Cancel,” “Back”) use consistent styling and positioning.
- Evaluate whether similar interactive components behave in the same way across contexts.

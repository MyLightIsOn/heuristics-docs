title: Are form labels visible and persistent?
---

### What this means
Form labels must remain visible at all times and clearly identify the purpose of their corresponding input fields. Labels should not disappear when the user interacts with the field or rely solely on placeholder text to convey information.

### Why this matters
Persistent labels ensure that users always understand what information is required, even after they begin typing. Relying on placeholder text alone creates usability barriers, particularly for users with cognitive or visual impairments. Disappearing labels can also create confusion during form review or error correction.

### What to check
- Confirm that every input field has a visible label adjacent to or directly associated with it.
- Verify that labels remain present when the field receives focus or contains user input.
- Check that placeholder text is not used as a substitute for labels.
- Ensure that the label is programmatically linked to the corresponding input (e.g., using `for` and `id` attributes).

title: Are form labels meaningful?
---

### What this means
Meaningful form labels clearly describe what information is expected in each form field. They should use plain, descriptive language that helps users understand exactly what they need to enter or select. A good form label acts as a clear instruction that leaves no ambiguity about the required input.

### Why this matters
Form labels are essential for all users but especially critical for those using assistive technology. Screen reader users rely on properly associated labels to understand the purpose of form controls. Without clear labels, users may not understand what information to enter, leading to errors, confusion, or abandonment of forms entirely.

Clear labels also benefit users with cognitive disabilities, who may need explicit instructions to complete forms correctly. Even users without disabilities benefit from unambiguous form fields that minimize confusion and streamline the completion process.

### What to check
- Are labels specific and descriptive rather than generic (e.g., "Your email address" instead of just "Email")?
- Are labels programmatically associated with their form controls using the 'for' attribute or by wrapping the input with the label?
- Do labels use plain language that avoids technical terms and industry jargon?
- Are labels positioned close to their corresponding form fields and visually connected?
- For required fields, is the requirement clearly indicated both visually and programmatically?
- Do complex inputs include additional instructions or examples of expected format?
- Are error messages specific about what went wrong and how to fix it?

title: Do all links have meaningful link text?
---

### What this means
Meaningful link text clearly communicates the destination or purpose of the link without relying on surrounding context. It should give users enough information to decide whether to follow the link before activating it. Link text should be concise but descriptive, avoiding generic phrases like "click here," "read more," or "learn more" when used alone.

### Why this matters
Screen reader users often navigate pages by tabbing through interactive elements or generating lists of all links on a page. When links use generic text like "click here" or "read more," these lists become meaningless without context. Users have to return to the content around each link to understand its purpose, which is inefficient and frustrating.

Meaningful link text also benefits users with cognitive disabilities who may struggle to understand links that require interpreting surrounding context. Additionally, descriptive links improve the experience for all users by making it easier to scan a page and quickly identify relevant navigation options.

### What to check for
- Avoid generic link text like "click here," "read more," or "learn more" without additional context
- Ensure link text accurately describes the destination or what will happen when activated
- Check that links with the same text don't lead to different destinations
- Verify that links with different text don't lead to the same destination (unless intended)
- For icon-only links, confirm they have appropriate accessible names (via aria-label or similar)
- Make sure PDF or document links indicate the file type and size when relevant
- Verify that links opening in a new window/tab inform users of this behavior
